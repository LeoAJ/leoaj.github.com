# My First Little Game

I am always a game lover, to build a game was a dream in my brain for a long period of time, this might be the first small and integrated game I have ever built, with simple different colors **apple** icons to composed the Tetris. Even though it is simple, I hope you all can enjoy it. Have Fun!!!

### HTML5 canvas

As you can see, all the graph you saw in this web app are created by HTML5 canvas. The main reason to focus on HTML5 canvas instead of just loading a image is because of performance. Loading image has a lot of latency, by using HTML5 canvas element I can reduce the loading latency and easily increase the performance.

# Simple twitter search jQuery plugin

Search any query word in Twiiter, limit search results and refresh results in specific period of time. To build as a jQuery plugin, it is easy to use and easy to extend for future usage.

### jQuery plugin

[jQuery](http://jquery.com){:target="_blank"} has been very popular in front-end development for a long time, one of the reason is it is flexibly and extensibility. **jQuery plugin** is one way we can extend out own function on top of jQuery, extend your function and keep the origin jQuery function, also, use **$** jQuery's global namespace to keep the code clean, not to mess up the code structure.

### Twitter API




> `JavaScript`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `Twitter API`, `jQuery`.

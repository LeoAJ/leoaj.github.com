# What kind of index would be efficient for searching big data?

I think this is one of the most interesting project that I have worked on. In this project, I will have to deal with a very large text file (more than 1 GB) with lots of actors, actresses names and movie names  that those movie star cast in,(data is from [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/){:target="_blank"}). My goal is to figure out the most efficient way to do the search, the less time spend the more it it efficiency.

In my approach, I build a basic hash index in dictionary structure in Python to increase the searching efficient of this big data. Because the normal search needs to take 1 second for exactly 1 character, which is too slow, in my approach, I successfully decrease the searching time less than 0.5 second.

### raw data format

As you can see the raw data format I got is actors' name with movie he cast seperate with a single tab, thus, first step of all is to re-format the data in order to use it.

### Hash structrue

The key element to speed up the searching is the data structure. I used hash which is key-value lookup table, the key is the first letter of last name, start from A to Z, and then it is associated with another hash its key is based on the first letter of first name.

### Index Builder

Index builder is the key element of entire program, it loaded the raw data, re-format and save it into memory in order to do search.

This is the basic workflow of entire program:

1. use index builder to re-format actors' data
2. use index builder to re-format actresses' data
3. combine and output result 1 & 2

### Demo

1. Initialization of entire program, loading and re-formatting data from A to Z alphabetically.

</figure>

2. Type search query to search

  <a href="/images/index-4.jpg"><img src="/images/index-4.jpg"></a>
</figure>

### Conclusion

Right now I think it is very obvious that the picture on the top is the search result of my name, of cource that I am not movie star. How to effcient use data is always huge challenges, and I am enjoy of solving those challenges.

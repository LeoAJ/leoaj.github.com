# Google App Engine Application

This is my first time to use Google App Engine to establish a project, it is a very useful tool for a developer essentially.

The general idea of this project is just like FaceBook, thus I called it ShareBook. To build a simple server to allow user to login and logout, and have uploading photo function. Once the user has profile in the server, the next function for user is to create its own friend list, which allow different users to share their photos. Finally, every photo could be tagged with comments, delete, rotate, vertical and horizontal flip.

### Login

  <a href="/images/share-1.jpg"><img src="/images/share-1.jpg"></a>

### Main page

Page tool bar and user email

<figure class="half">
  <a href="/images/share-2.jpg"><img class="borderFrame" src="/images/share-2.jpg"></a>
  <a href="/images/share-3.jpg"><img class="borderFrame" src="/images/share-3.jpg"></a>
</figure>

### Editting photo or friends list

You can add friend, tag photo or edit photo title

<figure class="half">
  <a href="/images/share-4.jpg"><img class="borderFrame" src="/images/share-4.jpg"></a>
  <a href="/images/share-5.jpg"><img class="borderFrame" src="/images/share-5.jpg"></a>
</figure>

### Photo info

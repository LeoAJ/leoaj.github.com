				<h4>Game with a purpose</h4>
				<p>In this project, we want to build a search engine for “blogs”, and try to use our method to rank the search results and compare to the googles’ results, final step is to let users to decide which ranking methods will be better.</p>

				<p>As you can see, in our result page we have two columns of results, the column A is the result retrieve from google by using google API. The column B is our ranking results by our page scoring method. All page we have searched are all blogs by extract keyword “wordpress”.</p>

				<p>I would like to thank my team member Ye Niu he is now working in the Youtube in this project, he helped a lot in project idea, server building and scoring page. Thank you and I can not finish this without you.</p>

			<section>
				<h4>Large web application based on web crawler</h4>
				<p>In this project, I developed a personalized search engine with based on the web crawler, once I start the search engine, it will crawl the particular URL first and store all data into memory for searching later.</p>

				<p>For every users, they will have basic user profile, including login, logout and change password function, allowed users to perform searches and maintain searched query history and visited links. </p>

				<p>There is a dynamic top 10 query word in the right side of the page, which is updating immediately once every query word got searched, the most used query word will set to be 
	No.1 in the top 10 query words.</p>

				<h4>Online instant database</h4>
				<p>I am a soccer fan, I would love to follow my favorite team and players performance. In order to that, I build a simple database for track all the teams and players performance for entire season, anyone who are sport enthusiasm will definitely love this one like me.</p>

				<p>I provided some functionality for users to track their favorite teams or players performance, such as the top scorers or best offensive teams etc. The entire application structure is simple, I have a simple web server build with Python, then connect to the Oracle database to fetch any information by SQL statement. After that, all the request function from users will output results as a HTML web page.</p>

			<h3>ShareBook</h3>

			<section>
				<h4>Google App Engine Application</h4>
				<p>This is my first time to use Google App Engine to establish a project, it is a very useful tool for a developer essentially. </p>

				<p>The general idea of this project is just like FaceBook, thus I called it ShareBook. To build a simple server to allow user to login and logout, and have uploading photo function. Once the user has profile in the server, the next function for user is to create its own friend list, which allow different users to share their photos. Finally, every photo could be tagged with comments, delete, rotate, vertical and horizontal flip.</p>

			<h3>Index Project</h3>
			<span class="code">Python</span>
			<div class="line"></div>
			<section>
				<h4>What kind of index would be efficient for searching?</h4>
				<p>In this project, I will have a very large text file with lots of actors and actresses name and movies that he or she starred in, I build a basic hash index in dictionary structure with Python to increase the searching efficient of this gigantic text file. Because the normal search needs to take 1 second for exactly 1 character, which is too slow.</p>

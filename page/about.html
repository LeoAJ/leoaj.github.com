				<h3>About me</h3>
				<p>
					It is a long journey for me to become a software engineer, I was not a CS major student when I was in the college, I have to work harder and harder to catch up with everybody else. It is my dream to be a software engineer, now, I am on the way of my dream, even though it is tough and it is hard, I will not give up because I believe someday, dream will come true.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					I like software because I believe software could make this world better. Once I would be able to help this world in someday in the future, software is the most powerful technology to make this world better and peace. To make contribution to this world is how I got taught before.
